Changes in version 1.3.1 (2021-11-18)

  functions for dimension reduction plot, drift plot, ECDF plot, mosaic plot,
  features along variable histogram, UpSet plot

Changes in version 1.1.3 (2021-09-30)
+ shift batch correction in between of normalization and transformation
+ add column "x5at1t1g161asy" instead of "rowname" (default) for 
  rownames_to_column

  - histogram of sample types,
  - information on number of missing/measured values
  - information on (intersecting, disjoint) sets for missing/measured values
  - barplot and violin plot for (count/intensity) values
  - visualization to detect drifts/trends in (count/intensity) values
  - coefficients of variation for samples,
  - mean-sd plots,
  - MA plots,
  - empirical cumulative distribution function,
  - visualizations of distances between samples,
  - intensities of features and coefficients of variation of features,

  - differential expression
+ write functions for data manipulation and plots 
+ write tests for these functions
+ create UI and server modules for shinyQC
+ write tests for UI and server modules
+ load different UI elements depending on the type of data (if the data 
  contains missing values or is complete)

  or not
