### Intersection of sets among a variable (UpSet plot)
The plot shows the interaction of sets between different variables depending 
on their absence. The dots in the UpSet plot specify if the 
criteria for absence are fulfilled:
Absence is defined by a feature with only missing values (i.e. no measured 
values) of a set. 
 
In each column the intersections are displayed together with the number 
of features regarding the type of intersection. The boxplots in the rows 
display the number of absent features per set. 

All sets present in the data set are displayed.  Depending on the data set, 
however, not all intersections sets are displayed 
(see the help page for the `upset` function from the `UpSetR` package).
