Description: 
	Data quality assessment is an integral part of preparatory data analysis 
	to ensure sound biological information retrieval. 
	We present here the MatrixQCvis package that allows for 
	shiny-based interactive visualization and assessment of data quality. 
	The application enables the detection of low-quality samples, outliers 
	and batch effects in data sets and their subsequent removal. Visualizations 
	include amongst others bar- and violin plots of the (count/intensity) 
	values, mean-sd plots, MA plots, empirical cumulative distribution function
	(ECDF) plots, visualizations of the distances between samples, and multiple 
	types of dimension reduction plots. Furthermore, MatrixQCvis allows for 
	differential expression analysis based on the limma (moderated t-tests) and 
	proDA (Wald tests) packages. MatrixQCvis builds upon the popular 
	Bioconductor SummarizedExperiment S4 class and enables thus the facile 
	integration into existing workflows. The package 
	is especially tailored towards metabolomics and proteomics mass spectrometry 
	data, but also allows to assess the data quality of other data types that 
	can be represented in a SummarizedExperiment object.
